# Why do we mess with statistics?

&lt;!-- include setup --&gt;





---

## Why statistics?

There is uncertainty in real-world data

--

- I am interested in measuring `\(x\)`, but lots of forces affect `\(x\)`

--

- Maybe I am interested in understanding the sizes of these forces

--

- How do you do that?


Your data are affected by forces that you can't see

--

- Models that describe our data have *unknown variables* ("parameters")

--

- How do we estimate those parameters?

## Let's flip a coin

If we flip a *fair* coin, what is the probability that it lands heads up?

&lt;!-- formalize this in the next lecture? --&gt;





---


## Let's flip a coin

Some R code...


```r
# two possible outcomes
coin &lt;- c("Heads", "Tails")

# one random sample
sample(coin, size = 1)
```

```
## [1] "Tails"
```



---

## What's going on here?

Observed data are influenced by underlying processes

--

- The coin flip (data) is influenced by an underlying *probability of Heads*

--

- There is a *systematic* component and a *random* component

--

- Statistical modeling is (in part) distinguishing systematic forces from random forces




---

## Statistics

The mathematical study of data

--

- Data come from some underlying, unknown process

--

- **Descriptive statistics:** describe the data (mean, standard deviation, correlations)

--

- **Inferential statistics:** describe the underlying process (as best we can)


--

We do plenty of both in political science, but the big focus is on inference

--

- We theorize about how politics works

--

- We collect data

--

- We *make inferences* about the processes that influence the data

--

- Are those inferences consistent with our theories?



---

class: center, middle

### Statistics has a role in the scientific process

When we analyze our data, statistics help(s) us interpret what the data show






---

## Statistics and probability

To make inferences about **data generating process**, we use probability

--

- Example: we have some data, but we don't know which process they come from

--

- We entertain a few possible different **models** (for the process), model `\(A\)`, model `\(B\)`...

--

- Data may be more probable under one model or another

--

- We can calculate the *probability of the data* under each model to pick the best model




---

## Probability in political science

- Describe the chances of particular events in politics (election outcomes, civil wars, social movements)

--

- What is the probability that the data come from such-and-such model?

--

- How certain (meaning, uncertain) are we about our findings?

--

- Formal theory: actors have uncertain beliefs about the game/other players, which are represented probabilistically






---

class: inverse, middle, center

# But before we can do any of that 

### We have to learn some basic math of probability







---

## Agenda

- Counting

- Set theory

- Probability

- Independence, Joint Probability

- Bayes' Theorem

- Looking ahead



---

## Helpful vocabulary

A **random variable** is a realization of a process that is at least partially random (i.e. unpredictable)

- e.g. coin flip, dice roll
- Probability enters statistics through the assumptions we make about the type of randomness in a random variable

--

A random variable could have many different potential outcomes (e.g. heads vs. tails). The probability of these outcome could be unequal (e.g. Clinton wins vs. Trump wins). 

--

If we wanted to describe the probability of each potential outcome, we would do so with a *probability distribution.*

- A probability distribution is a *function* which maps potential outcomes to the probability of those outcomes. 
- `\(x\)` = potential outcome
- `\(f(x) =\)` probability of `\(x\)`
- These matter even for formal (non-statistical) models (e.g. utility shocks)

---

## More about probability distributions

Probability distributions can describe discrete outcomes (coin flips) or continuous outcomes (height, vote margin)

--

Probability distributions always sum to 1

- "The law of total probability"
- Discrete distributions: sum the probabilities of all potential outcomes
- Continuous distributions: integrate over the continuous space of outcomes

--

Probability distributions are fundamentally where all statistical inference happens

- `\(z\)`-scores, `\(p\)`-values
- Prior and posterior beliefs

## Counting




---

## Counting

First, what is probability?

--

- The ratio of an event's *expected frequency* to the number of possible events
--

- We need to count the events in question &amp; total possible outcomes

--

Suppose an **event** is described by `\(K\)` different component parts. (E.g. we roll a die `\(K\)` many times). Each component `\(k = \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}\)` has `\(n_{k}\)` possible values. What is the number of distinct outcomes we could get? 

--

`$$\prod\limits_{k = 1}^{K} n_{k}$$`

(multiply the `\(n_{k}\)`'s)



---

class: center, middle

I roll a 6-sided die 4 times. How many unique sets of 4 rolls can I obtain (assuming that different orderings of the same 4 numbers are different events). 


---

## Complex counting considerations

Does the *order of selection* matter? (is `\(\{1, 2\} = \{2, 1\}\)`)

- No ordering: number of Heads in 100 coin flips
- Ordering: expected number of flips to find Heads followed by Tails

--

Are selected objects *replaced* (able to be selected again) or *not replaced*?

- Replacement: rolling two dice
- No replacement: dealing cards





---

## Ordering with replacement

This is easiest because (a) no need to adjust for "double-counting" and (b) the number of possibilities is always constant.

The number of possible ways to select `\(k\)` elements from a larger pool of `\(n\)` is

`$$n \times n \times n \times \ldots \times n = n^{k}$$`

Intuition: in each draw, there are `\(n\)` possibilities. Each of `\(n\)` outcomes in one draw can be combined with the `\(n\)` outcomes in any (and all) other draws.

--

How many unique paths through a game of Chutes and Ladders



---

class: center, middle

### As we add restrictions, counting gets harder

So we have names for different ways of counting




---

## Order, no replacement

Also called **Permutation**.

The number of ways to select `\(k\)` objects from a pool of `\(n\)` possible objects, where order matters but replacement does not occur. 

Intuition: each draw *removes the object* from the larger pool. Subsequent draws have one less element to choose from. 

--

`$$\begin{align}
  n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * \ldots * (n - k - 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}
\end{align}$$`

--

For example: number of possible ways to deal a card game, lottery numbers, number of possible rankings in a race





---

## Unordered, No Replacement

Also called **combinations**: The number of possible ways to select `\(k\)` objects from a pool of `\(n\)` possible objects, where *order does not matter* and *replacement does not occur*

Intuition: we have fewer possibilities than before, substantively identical elements ( `\(A\)` and then `\(B\)`, vs `\(B\)` and then `\(A\)`) are not double counted. 

`$$\begin{align}
  \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} &amp;= {\binom{n}{k}}
\end{align}$$`

For example: survey samples, raffles, possible groups of 2 in a classroom



---

## Unordered, with replacement

The number of possible ways to select `\(k\)` elements from a larger pool of `\(n\)` possible elements, where order does not matter and replacement does occur

`$$\frac{(n + k - 1)!}{(n-1)!k!} = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}$$`

Example: Yahtzee dice rolls, the number of heads if you flip a coin `\(n\)` times





---

## Exercises

Imagine we rank the 3 top swimmers in this room. 

- Is this a situation where order matters?
--

- Is this a situation with replacement, or no replacement? 
--

- How many different possible rankings could there be? 

--

Imagine we have 4 different scholarships for students in this room. You can win more than one scholarship. How many different combinations of winners can there be?

--

Imagine we have 5 identical candies for students in this room. You can win more than 1 candy. How many different combinations of winners can there be? 

--

Imagine we have 2 identical bicycles for students in this room. You can only win 1 candy. How many combinations of winners?

## Set theory



---

## Sets

Remember: a **set** is a collection of elements. Could be numbers, units, areas in space...

.pull-left[
- `\(F = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)`
- `\(G = \{1, 3, 5\}\)`
- `\(H = [0, 1] \cup (2, 3)\)`

What are unions? Intersections? Disjoints? Subsets? Supersets?
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img width = 90% src="img/sets.png"&gt;
]

- `\(P = \{\mathrm{Reagan}, \mathrm{Bush41}, \mathrm{Clinton}, \mathrm{Bush43}, \mathrm{Obama}, \mathrm{Trump}\}\)`
- `\(D = \{\mathrm{Carter}, \mathrm{Mondale}, \mathrm{Dukakis}, \mathrm{Clinton}, \mathrm{Gore}, \mathrm{Kerry}, \mathrm{Obama}, \mathrm{HRC}\}\)`
- `\(R = \{\mathrm{Reagan}, \mathrm{Bush41}, \mathrm{Dole}, \mathrm{Bush43}, \mathrm{McCain}, \mathrm{Romney}, \mathrm{Trump}\}\)`
- `\(I = \{\mathrm{Perot}, \mathrm{Nader}\}\)`


---



## The sample space

The **sample space** (denoted `\(S\)` or `\(\Omega\)`) is the set that contains all elements in question. 

Sometimes called the *universal set*

--

Not the same as the set that contains *everything*. Only the relevant things for what we're currently talking about.


---

## Complementary sets

The **complement** of set `\(A\)` (denoted as `\(A^{C}\)`) is the set of all elements in the sample space that are *not contained* in `\(A\)`

`$$A^{C} \equiv X \text{ such that } X \notin A$$`

--

Example, `\(\Omega = [0, 1]\)`

- If `\(X = (0, 0.5]\)`, what is `\(X^{C}\)`?
--

- `\(X^{C} = \{0\} \cup (0.5, 1]\)`

--

What is `\(\Omega^{C}\)`?

--

- `\(\emptyset\)`

## Making sense?





---

# Probability (beginning with sets)






---

## Probability as Sets

We can use sets to represent the probability of events. Total area represents total probability of all events (equal to `\(1\)`). 

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 40% src="img/prob-a.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

`\(A\)` is an event, and its area is a subset of the total area. 

--

.pull-left[
`\(\mathrm{Pr}(A)\)`?
] 

.pull-right[
`\(\mathrm{Pr}(A^{C})\)`?
]




---

## Let's play cards

We have 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs) and 13 card values (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Jack, Queen, King). Suits and values can both be sets.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width = 90% src="img/cards-blank.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

Total area = 1

Probability of an individual card: `\(\frac{1}{52}\)`



---

## Properties of probabilities

Probabilities are strictly bounded on the closed interval `\([0, 1]\)`

- `\(p(A) \in [0, 1]\)`
--

- `\(A\)` is either impossible ( `\(p = 0\)`), certain ( `\(p = 1\)`), or in between (possible, `\(p \in (0, 1)\)`)

--

If we had `\(N\)` many *exhaustive* and *mutually exclusive* set of potential outcomes, their probabilities sum to 1. Which is to say, *something must happen*.

`$$\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{N} p(A_{n}) = 1$$`





---

## Probability of complements

If `\(\Omega\)` contains the set of all potential outcomes, and `\(A\)` is an event that is a subset of the outcome space that occurs with `\(p(A)\)`

- What is `\(p(A^{C})\)`?

--

- `\(1 - p(A)\)`

--

The intuition: *Something* must happen, either `\(A\)` or not- `\(A\)`





---

## Example of complements

Probability that a random card is a Heart? `\(p(H) = \frac{1}{4}\)`
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img width = 70% src="img/cards-hearts.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--


Probability that a card is not a heart? `\(1 - p(H) = \frac{3}{4}\)`




---

## Probability of unions

.pull-left[
The probability of `\(A \cup B\)`

The probability that *either* `\(A\)` or `\(B\)` occurs



]

.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 90% src="img/prob-a.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

--

`\(p(A \cup B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A \cap B)\)`

--

The intuition: the sum of `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` will double count `\(A \cap B\)`, so we need to subtract one instance of `\(A \cap B\)`





---

## Probability of Unions

What is the probability that we draw a card that is *either* a heart *or* a face card?

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 80% src="img/cards-union-intersect.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

`\(p(H) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(F) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(H \cap F) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(H \cup F) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{12}{52} - \frac{3}{52} = \frac{22}{52}\)`




---

## Probability of intersections

.pull-left[
The probability of `\(A \cap B\)`

The probability that *both* `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` occur
]

.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 90% src="img/prob-a.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

--

`$$p(A \cap B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A \cup B)$$`

The intuition: We care only about the component that we double counted




---

## Probability of intersections

What is the probability that we draw a card that is *both* a heart *and* a face card?

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 80% src="img/cards-union-intersect.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

`\(p(H) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(F) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(H \cup F) = ?\)`

--

`\(p(H \cap F) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{12}{52} - \frac{22}{52} = \frac{3}{52}\)`








---

## Conditional probability

The probability of `\(A\)`, given `\(B\)`, is expressed as `\(p(A \mid B)\)`

.pull-left[

What is the probability of `\(A\)`, given that `\(B\)` also occurs?

]

.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 70% src="img/prob-a.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

--

`$$p(A \mid B) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(B)}$$`

The intuition:

- If we *know* that `\(B\)` happened, we only care about the space within `\(B\)`
--

- the probability that both `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` happen, divided by the probability of `\(B\)` 
--

- `\(p(\mathrm{intersection}) \; / \; p(\text{conditioning event})\)`




---

## Conditional probability

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 80% src="img/cards-blank.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

What is the probability of drawing the Ace of Diamonds? 

--

What is the probability of drawing the Ace of Diamonds, *given that* we have have drawn an Ace?

--

- `\(p(\text{Ace of Diamonds}) = \frac{1}{52}\)`
--

- `\(p(\mathrm{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52}\)`
--

- `\(p(\text{Ace of Diamonds} \mid \mathrm{Ace}) = \frac{{1/52}}{{4/52}} = \frac{1}{4}\)`




---

## What's the probability?


&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width = 80% src="img/cards-blank.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

`\(p(\{8, 9, 10\})\)`

`\(p(\{5, 6\} \cup \{6, 10\})\)`

`\(p(A \mid H^{C})\)`




---

## The notion of *independence*

Two events are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one event does not change the probability of the other

--

.pull-left[

&lt;center&gt;
Independent
  &lt;img width = 75% src="img/shapes-ind.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

`$$p(B) = p(B \mid A)$$`
]

--

.pull-right[

&lt;center&gt;
Dependent
  &lt;img width = 75% src="img/shapes-dep.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

`$$p(B) \neq p(B \mid A)$$`

]




---

## Independence of Events

Is drawing a face card independent of drawing a face card?

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width=80% src="img/cards-ind.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

`\(p(F \mid H) = \frac{3}{13}\)`

--

`\(p(F) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}\)`


---

## Independence of Events

What about drawing a face card independent of drawing a card greater than 8?

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img width=80% src="img/cards-dep.png"&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

`\(p(X = F \mid X &gt; 8) = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}\)`

--

`\(p(F) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}\)`







---

## Joint probability

What we're doing here is considering the probability of *multiple events*

**Joint probability**: the probability of *more than one event* occurring simultaneously

--

`\(p(A, B) \equiv p(A) \cap p(B)\)`

--

The exact equation for the joint probability depends on whether the events are *independent*




---

##  Joint probability of independent events

This is the easy stuff. If multiple events are independent of one another, the joint probability of all events is the *product* of the individual probabilities.

--

Example, we flip three coins independently of one another. What's the probability of the sequence `\(\{H, H, H\}\)`?

--

`$$\begin{align}
  p(H) \times p(H) \times p(H) &amp;= .5 \times .5 \times .5 \\
  &amp;= 0.125
\end{align}$$`





---

### So we've got two bowls

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/urns.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

If we draw a ball from each earn, what is the joint probability of...

- `\(p(\mathrm{blue, green}) =\)` ?

- `\(p(\mathrm{blue, yellow}) =\)` ?

- `\(p(\mathrm{red, green}) =\)` ?

- `\(p(\mathrm{red, yellow}) =\)` ?




---

### So we've got two bowls

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/urns.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

If we draw a ball from each earn, what is the joint probability of...

- `\(p(\mathrm{blue, green}) = \left( \frac{40}{50} \right)\left( \frac{30}{50}    \right) = (.8)(.6) = .48\)`

- `\(p(\mathrm{blue, yellow}) = \left( \frac{40}{50} \right)\left( \frac{20}{50}     \right) = (.8)(.4) = .32\)`

- `\(p(\mathrm{red, green}) = \left( \frac{10}{50} \right)\left( \frac{30}{50}    \right) = (.2)(.6) = .12\)`

- `\(p(\mathrm{red, yellow}) = \left( \frac{10}{50} \right)\left( \frac{20}{50}     \right) = (.2)(.4) = .08\)`

--

Because these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, probabilities sum to 1







---

Imagine we flip a coin. If heads, we draw a ball from the left bowl. If tails, we draw from the right. 

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/complex-urns.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

This means there are two ways to choose a blue ball: `\(\{A, \mathrm{blue}\}\)` and `\(\{B, \mathrm{blue}\}\)`

--

- `\(p(A,  \mathrm{blue}) = 0.5 * \frac{45}{50} = 0.45\)`
- `\(p(B,  \mathrm{blue}) = 0.5 * \frac{20}{50} = 0.20\)`

--

Total probability of blue is the sum of the joint probabilities (a very useful principle...)

--

`$$\begin{align}
  p(\mathrm{blue}) &amp;= p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A) + p(\mathrm{blue} \mid B) \\
  &amp;= p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A) + p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A^{C})
\end{align}$$`



---

## Thinking about order and replacement

We draw 5 balls from one urn, replacing each time. We get the following sequence:

.pull-left[
&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/one-urn.png" width=90%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

.pull-right[

`\(\{\mathrm{blue}, \mathrm{red}, \mathrm{blue}, \mathrm{blue}, \mathrm{red}\}\)`

The probability of *this specific sequence* is `\(.3 * .7 * .3 * .3 * .7 = 0.01323\)`,

or if we simplify: `\(0.3^{3}0.7^{2}\)`

]

Imagine we don't care about the order, just the probability of three blues (which implies two reds)

--
- The *total probability* of 3 blues: sum the `\(p\)` of every sequence that has 3 blues
--

- Any individual sequence that with 3 blues has probability `\(0.01323\)` (above)
--

- We just need the *number of ways* to get 3 blues with 5 draws

--

`$$\begin{align}
  \left(\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!}\right)(.3)^3(.7)^2 &amp;= \binom{5}{3}(.3)^3(.7)^2 = (10)(.01323) = .1323
\end{align}$$`

### (Spooky voice) "Inverse conditional probabilityyyy"

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/urn-bayes.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Someone flips a coin to decide whether to draw a ball from bowl `\(A\)` or `\(B\)` (each with 50% probability), but the bowl is hidden from us.

--

- What is the probability of drawing from bowl `\(A\)`?

--

- We've drawn a *blue* ball. What's the probability that we drew from `\(A\)`?

--

"Inverse" conditional probability problem: 

- It's easy to find `\(p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A)\)`, 
- but how can we *invert* it to find `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)`?





---

### Find `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)`

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/urn-bayes.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

How do we approach any conditional probability problem? 

--

`$$p(y \mid x) = \dfrac{p(y \, \cap \, x)}{p(x)}$$`

--

So what do we need for `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)`?
--

- `\(p(A \cap \mathrm{blue})\)`

--

- `\(p(\mathrm{blue})\)`





---

### Find `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)`


&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src="img/urn-bayes.png" width = 80%&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

`\(p(A \cap \mathrm{blue})\)`?
--

- `\((0.5)(0.9) = 0.45\)`
- This is (associatively) the same as `\(p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A)p(A)\)`

--

`\(p(\mathrm{blue})\)`?

- `\(p(A \cap \mathrm{blue}) + p(B \cap \mathrm{blue})\)`
--

- `\((0.5)(0.9) + (0.5)(0.4) = 0.45 + 0.20 = 0.65\)`




---

### Find `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)`

`$$\begin{align}
  p(A \mid \mathrm{blue}) &amp;= \frac{p(A \cap \mathrm{blue})}{p(\mathrm{blue})} \\[6pt]
  p(A \mid \mathrm{blue}) &amp;= \frac{p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A)p(A)}{p(\mathrm{blue})} \\[6pt]
  p(A \mid \mathrm{blue}) &amp;= \frac{0.45}{0.65} &amp;\approx 0.69
\end{align}$$`

--

This is **inverse conditional probability**: how we find `\(p(A \mid \mathrm{blue})\)` by starting with `\(p(\mathrm{blue} \mid A)\)`.

## We just did Bayes' theorem

Congratulations, you're Bayesians now


---

## Bayes' Theorem


--

Generally it's true that `\(p(x \mid y) = \dfrac{p(x \, \cap \, y)}{p(y)} = \dfrac{p(x \, \cap \, y)}{p(y \, \cap \, x) + p(y \, \cap \, x^{c})}\)`

--

Bayes' Theorem describes how to find solve equation by beginning with its inverse

`$$\begin{align}
  p(x \mid y) = \frac{p(y \mid x)p(x)}{p(y)}
\end{align}$$`

--

Or, more generally


`$$\begin{align}
  p(x \mid y) &amp;= \frac{p(y \mid x)p(x)}{p(y \mid x)p(x) + p(y \mid x^{c})p(x^{c})}
\end{align}$$`

## A common Bayes example

A rare disease occurs in .01% of the population. We have a test for it, but it isn't perfect. 98% of individuals with the condition will test positive (1% false negative). 97% of those without the condition test negative (3% false positive). 

--

You get the test done. The test is positive.

--

What's the probability that you have the disease? 

--

- **Prior probability:** .01% you have the disease
- What is the **updated (posterior) probability** that you have the disease, *given that you test positive*



---

## Applying Bayes

`$$\begin{align}
  \text{Posterior probability} &amp;= \frac{p(\mathrm{data} \mid \mathrm{prior}) \times \mathrm{prior}}{p(\mathrm{data})} \\[6pt]
  p(\mathrm{disease} | +) &amp;= \frac{p(+ \, \cap \, \mathrm{disease})}{p(+)} \\[6pt]
  p(\mathrm{disease} | +) &amp;= \frac{p(+ \, \cap \, \mathrm{disease})}{p(+ \, \cap \, \mathrm{disease}) + p(+ \, \cap \, \mathrm{disease}^{c})} \\[6pt]
  p(\mathrm{disease} | +) &amp;= \frac{p(+ \mid \mathrm{disease})p(\mathrm{disease})}{p(+ \mid \mathrm{disease})p(\mathrm{disease}) + p(+ \mid \mathrm{disease}^{c})p(\mathrm{disease}^{c})} \\[6pt]
  .003 &amp;\approx \frac{(.98)(.0001)}{(.98)(.0001) + (.03)(.9999)}
\end{align}$$`

--

If our prior is .01% chance of disease, a positive test *revises the probability* to .3%. 

--

This is called *Bayesian updating*



---

## Why Bayes is hard

Take a look at the denominator of Bayes' theorem

`$$\text{Posterior probability} = \frac{p(\mathrm{data} \mid \mathrm{prior}) \times \mathrm{prior}}{p(\mathrm{data \mid \mathrm{prior}})\mathrm{prior} + p(\mathrm{data \mid \mathrm{prior}^{c}})\mathrm{prior}^{c}}$$`

Imagine we have a continuous prior. E.g. we believe that the probability of a coin flip is *close to 0.5* but we are a little uncertain (due to the weight of the coin sides). 

--

In situations like this, our prior takes the form of a continuous probability distribution where each potential value has an associated probability. 

--

If we have a continuous parameter, summing anything across all values (e.g. `\(\mathrm{prior}^{c}\)`) means integrating. And integrating is hard. 

--

As a result, if you ever want to do Bayesian analysis for your own research, it tends to be computationally expensive (slow) and somewhat approximate.

--

Moreover, our results are *distributions*, not just single estimates.


---

### A continuous example

We think that the probability of a "heads" on a coin is most likely 0.5, but we aren't certain about that. We flip the coin 12 times and find 10 heads. What is our revised belief?

---

## Wait, how can "beliefs" affect probability?

Depends what we're talking about. There are two big ways to think about probability:

--

1. Over a large number of repeated, controlled trials, probability is the fraction of trials in which an event occurs.

--

2. Probability is never something that we *know*, only something that we learn about. Given our most reasonable information and evidence about the setting, how likely is an event?

--

More generally, we are interested in estimating unknown parameters in a mathematical model of a social interaction.

--

1. The parameter is unknown but *fixed*. There is an honest-to-god true value, and we are estimating it using data.

--

2. The parameter is unknown, and our information about it will always be imperfect. The information we obtain (*conditioning on* our model, on our data) can only approximate a *distribution* of possible values that are more or less plausible.


---

## The two statistical genders

--

.pull-left[
"Frequentism"

- Statistical properties come from repeated sampling assumptions
- There exists a true parameter, which we estimate
- We can calculate probability that our data were created by different assumed parameter values
- Low probability of data can be used to reject parameter values
- Focus is on the probability of the *data*, assuming a fixed parameter
]



--

.pull-left[
"Bayesianism"

- Statistical properties come from *posterior distribution*
- Parameters are "random" as in, not fixed, only approximated with a distribution
- We have prior notions about plausible parameter values
- We can estimate the likelihood of data at different prior values
- Data updates our prior to form posterior beliefs
- Focus is on the probability of the *parameter*, updating a prior with data
]



---

class: center, middle

### If you ask me

While Frequentism itself is not evil, it has been *made evil* by research that regularly abuses its underlying epistemic logic. This culture of abuse (which I call the Frequentist Menace&amp;trade;) is a pox on the scientific method and it must be destroyed

but I hold a minority view!

## Methods courses

If you want to understand statistical work in political science, you should do:

- 812, 813, MLE
- Empirical methods (817)

Formal theory courses:

- 835 (game theory)
- Formal models of domestic (836?) and international (837?) politics

Advanced methods courses include

- Multilevel modeling, Time series, Panel data, Bayesian analysis, Experimental methods


Courses outside the department:

- Ag econ: applied regression, choice models
- Sociology: causal inference, networks(?)
- Statistics: networks, machine learning



---

## Methods pathways

Take the foundations courses no matter what

First field: "I want to study *how to study* politics". You still need a substantive interest

Second field: "I want to teach and research about/use new methods," not just, "I can do statistics okay"

Minor field: 3 courses (see reqs)


---

## My advice for methods courses

Take as many as you feasibly can. No, really. Soak it up.

Don't delay MLE. 

Even if you a qualitative researcher, the *epistemological* lessons of large-N analysis are valuable. 

If you're going to *read* empirical social science, you should take empirical social science courses.

Pick something you like and get good at it

- Time series, Bayes, text as data, matching, causal inference, experiments

Do replication projects



---

## My advice for methods in the *discipline*

Learn an unfamiliar method from a different field/subfield and apply it to your interests

Take the open science and the "replication crisis" seriously

Take math seriously (it helps you ride the learning curve)

Be a [plain text social scientist](http://plain-text.co/) (take your computer seriously)

Learn `\(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\)`, learn R, learn `git`. Stata works but tbh I think we're way past the inflection point

If you might leave academia for data science, consider Python and machine learning
