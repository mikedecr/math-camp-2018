### First...

## Numbers









---

## Math: not just numbers

Math is a general framework for manipulating various concepts, *one of which* is "numbers"

Types of numbers:

- Integers (whole numbers, including negative): `\(\mathbb{Z}\)`
- Real numbers (the continuous number line): `\(\mathbb{R}\)`
- Positive and negative real numbers: `\(\mathbb{R}^{+}\)` and `\(\mathbb{R}^{-}\)`
- Real numbers in `\(n\)` dimensions: `\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\)`
- Complex numbers: `\(\mathbb{C}\)`
  + `\(1 + 2i\)`
  + where `\(i = \sqrt{-1}\)`






---

## Special numbers

`\(0\)` and `\(1\)`: 
--

- useful for identities in addition and multiplication
  
  + `\(4 + 0 = 4\)`
  
  + `\(1 * x = x\)`

--

- Useful for turning "off" and "on" pieces of an equation

  + We have an equation: `\(4 + z(5x) + (1 - z)3x\)` 

--

  + What happens if `\(z = 0\)`? 

--

  + If `\(z = 1\)`?


---

## Special numbers

`\(\pi\)`: Approximately `\(3.1415926\)` ... 

- Ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
- Useful for angles, circles, polar coordinates (which you may use!)

--

`\(e\)`: Euler's number

- Approximately `\(2.718281828\)` ... 
- Derivative of `\(e^{x}\)` is equal to `\(e^{x}\)`
- *Very* important for probability and statistics

--

`\(i\)`: The imaginary number, `\(\sqrt{-1}\)`. For advanced algebra

--

`\(\infty\)`: Infinity. Not really a number but a boundless quantity



---

## Numbers and variables

We can manipulate numbers with simple operations

--

- addition: `\(1 + 2\)`

--

- subtraction: `\(3 - 4\)`

--

- multiplication: `\(5 \times 6\)`

--

- division: `\(7 \div 8\)`

--

We can *generalize* these statements by using *variables*

- `\(1 + x\)`
- `\(3 - y\)`
- `\(5 \times a\)`
- `\(7 \div m\)`

*Variable*: a symbol to represent an entity that could take different values

# Equations

Statements about equality and inequality

---

## Equations

Equality: left-hand and right-hand sides (LHS and RHS) are substitutable.

If `\(a = 7x\)`, then `\(8*a\)` and `\(8 * 7x\)` are equivalent statements

--

- Usually used to find *new ways to express a known idea* or to *derive implications from known ideas*


--

*Inequalities* show whether LHS or RHS is greater

- Usually we use them to find the *conditions under which a statement holds*




---

## Solving equalities and inequalities

Isolate an unknown quantity to express it in terms of known quantities

--

Solve for `\(x\)`: 

`$$-7x + 3 = 12$$`

--

Solve for `\(x\)`: 

`$$-7x + 3 &gt; 12$$`

--

Remember to flip an inequality if you multiply by a negative number!

# Data




---

## Data

The information we record about what we study

- **Cases:** The units being studied (rows)
- **Variables:** Characteristics that describe units (columns)
- **Values:** Specific realization of a variable (cells)

| Establishment     | Location      | Coffee | Vibe | Notable Flaw |
|:------------------|:--------------|-------:|:-----|:-------------|
| Aldo's            | Campus        | 7      | good | no plugs 
| Ancora            | Capitol       | 8      | great | hours 
| Barriques         | Capitol       | 6      | good | bathroom key 
| Colectivo         | State St.     | 7      | fair | spotty wifi 
| Fair Trade        | State St.     | 8      | good | expensive, tables 
| Michelangelo's    | Capitol       | 5      | meh | bathroom key 
| Steep &amp; Brew      | Bascom Hill   | 1      | fair | truly the worst coffee ever

## Classifying data

Quantitative vs. Qualitative *analysis*

- Broad, sometimes contentious, arguably artificial divides in the study of politics
- Quantitative: larger `\(n\)`, statistical description and inference
- Qualitative: smaller `\(n\)`, rich description, non-statistical inference

Quantitative vs. Qualitative *variables*

- Quantitative: countable, numeric (age, number of toes)
- Qualitative: not countable but descriptive (gender, party preference)
- Unlike qualitative *research*, qualitative variables can still be organized in a data table

I advise not getting too hung up these classification systems. Use them only until you can lose them


---

## Discrete vs. Continuous 

Discrete

- Variables take specific values from a finite set of possible values
- Could be categories, could be discrete numbers
- Level of the atmosphere, number of parties, country of origin

Dichotomous

- Special type of discrete variable, two possible values
- 0 or 1, yes or no, war or peace, win or lose, voted or not

Continuous

- Variables take values from a continuous number line
- Could be a bounded number line
- GDP, vote share, percentage of turnout, unemployment rate



---

## Related: the "levels of measurement"

Nominal / Categorical

- *Unordered* categories
- e.g. party affiliation, gender, country of origin, occupation

Ordinal

- *Ordered* or *ranked* outcomes
- Could be categories, but numbers are possible (e.g. rankings)
- No fixed "distance" between levels
- e.g. highest level of educational attainment, levels of democratization, issue prioritization


---

## Related: the "levels of measurement"

Interval

- Ordered values with *fixed distance between levels*
- But *no true zero point*
- Issue scales, day of the year, Likert scales (debatable)

Ratio:

- Ordered, fixed intervals, *and true zero*
- Vote percentage, turnout, minutes in line to vote



---

## Why do these categorizations matter?

Different types of variables lend themselves to different types of analysis

--

- Types of statistics you calculate 

--

- Possibilities for data visualization

--

- Statistical models (You will learn if you take 812, 813, MLE, etc.)

--

  + **Discrete/Nominal**: logistic regression (logit), multinomial logit, `\(\chi^{2}\)` (chi-square)
  
--

  + **Ordinal**: Ordinal logit, also `\(\chi^{2}\)`
  
--

  + **Interval**: least-squares regression
  
--

  + **Ratio**: least-squares, count/rate models, duration/survival models

# Sets

(useful for "speaking math" about data)




---

## Sets

Collections of objects or entities

--

Sets contain "elements" or "members"

- if `\(o\)` is in set `\(A\)`, then we write `\(o \in A\)` 
- `\(o\)` "is an element of" `\(A\)`

--


Sets could contain individual numbers, but they could contain other sorts of entities

- vectors, matrices
- functions, probability distributions (which are...?)







---

class: center, middle

### We need *only some* set notation to help us work with data







---

## What's in a set?

A set could contain individual elements, written as 

`\(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\)`

--

A set could contain intervals

- `\(B = [1, 10]\)` (square brackets imply that endpoints are included)
--

- Is it the case that `\(A = B\)`?
--

- `\(C = (0, 11)\)` (parentheses indicate that endpoints are not included)
- Does `\(B = C\)`?




---

## Set notation

`\(\cup\)`: the *union* of two sets

- elements that are members of either set
- if `\(A = \{1, 2\}\)` and `\(B = \{2, 3\}\)`, then `\(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\}\)`

--

`\(\cap\)`: the *intersection* of two sets

- elements that are members of both sets
- if `\(A = \{1, 2\}\)` and `\(B = \{2, 3\}\)`, then `\(A \cap B = \{2\}\)`

--

(interestingly enough, these concepts are helpful for probabilities)

--

`\(\emptyset\)`: the empty set (null set)

## Symbols and Set Notation

A handful of symbols are commonly used when we represent data mathematically.

| Symbol    | Meaning                                     |
| :-        | :-                                          |
| `\(&gt;\)`       | greater than
| `\(\geq\)`    | greater than or equal to
| `\(&lt;\)`       | (less than)
| `\(\leq\)`    | less than or equal to
| `\(\approx\)` | approximately equal to `\((x \approx y)\)`
| `\(\equiv\)`  | equivalent to (for establishing identities)
| `\(\propto\)` | proportional to `\((4x \propto x)\)`





---

## Symbols and Set Notation

| Symbol            | Meaning                                              |
| :-                | :-                                                   |
| `\(\neg\)`            | not
| `\(/\)`               | not (if through a symbol)
| `\(\mid\)`            | given that `\((A \mid B)\)`
| `\(\in\)`             | is an element of a set `\((x_{i} \in \mathbf{x})\)`
| `\(\to\)`             | implies `\((A \to B)\)`
| `\(\leftrightarrow\)` | if and only if ( `\([x = y] \leftrightarrow [y = x]\)` )




---

##  Subsets

if `\(A = \{1, 2\}\)` and `\(B = \{1, 2, 3\}\)`:
--

- `\(A \subseteq B\)` means "A is a subset of B"
--

- Can `\(A\)` be a subset of `\(A\)`?
--

- using `\(\subseteq\)`, yes it can

--

"Proper subset"
--

- `\(A \subset B\)`
- `\(A\)` isn't a proper subset of `\(A\)`
- proper subsets can't be equivalent to their superset



---

## Indexing

Variables can be sets, and they can take different values for different individuals in a dataset. It is convenient to *index* individual observations using a subscript (typically `\(i\)`). 

| Student | Math Courses in College |
|--------:|------------------------:|
| 1       | 3
| 2       | 0
| 3       | 1
| 4       | 4

If `\(x\)` represents the number of math courses, `\(x_{i}\)` refers to the `\(i\)`th observation in `\(x\)`

- `\(x_{1} = 3\)`
- `\(x_{2} = 0\)`
- `\(x_{3} = ?\)`
- `\(x_{4} = ?\)`

## Set practice



---

## Consider the following sets

`\(A = \{10, 20, 30\}\)`

`\(B = [1, 10]\)`

`\(C = (0, 40)\)`

--
- what is `\(A \cap B\)`?

--

- is `\(B \subseteq C\)`?

--

- is `\(A_{2} \in B\)`

--

- Which elements in `\(A\)` are subsets of `\(B\)`? Subsets of `\(C\)`?

--

- is `\((A \cup C) \subset C\)`?






---

## Set notation in the wild

Almost verbatim from a paper about congressional votes ("roll call votes")&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;sup&gt;
- The data consist of `\(n\)` legislators voting on `\(m\)` different roll calls [bills].
- Each roll call `\(j = 1, \ldots , m\)` presents legislators `\(i =1,\ldots,n\)` with a choice between a 'Yea' position `\(\zeta_{j}\)` and a 'Nay' position `\(\Psi_{j}\)`, locations in `\(\mathbb{R}\)`
- Let `\(y_{ij} = 1\)` if legislator `\(i\)` votes Yea on the `\(j\)`th roll call and `\(y_{ij} = 0\)` otherwise.

| Legislator ( `\(i\)` ) | Bill ( `\(j\)` ) | Vote ( `\(y\)` )
| ----:              | -----:       | ---:         |
| 1                  | 1            | 0
| 1                  | 2            | 1
| `\(\vdots\)`           | `\(\vdots\)`     | `\(\vdots\)`
| `\(n\)`                | `\(m\)`          | `\(y_{nm}\)` |

# Functions




---

## Functions

Operations or rules of assignment that map an input to a *unique* (that is, exactly one) output

--

- inputs: also called arguments
- outputs: also called values
- mapping: also called the *definition*
--

- `\(\mathrm{value} = f(\mathrm{argument})\)`
- `\(f = \text{[insert definition]}\)`

--

Analogies include:

- algorithms, machines, black box, routinized process





---

## Functions

We can generically refer to functions using `\(f(x)\)` or `\(g(x)\)`, just as we might use variables to stand in for values.

--

- e.g. let `\(f(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)\)`
--

- `\(f(0.5) = ?\)`

--

Other symbols also are fine, e.g.

- `\(\Phi\left( \cdot \right)\)`
- `\(\Gamma(\cdot)\)`
- `\(B(\cdot)\)`
- `\(\Lambda(\cdot)\)`





---

## Operators

*Operators* are components of a function that tell what to do with the inputs to produce the outputs

Several common operators serve as the building blocks of mathematical functions

- `\(+\)`
- `\(-\)`
- `\(\times\)`
- `\(/\)`

--

Order of operations:

- operations within parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and division (left to right)
- Addition and subtraction (left to right)






---

## Function examples

| `\(x\)` | `\(y\)` | `\(z\)` || `\(f(x,y) = x - y\)`  || `\(g(z) = 2z - 1\)` || `\(h(x,y,z) = \displaystyle\frac{x+y}{z}\)` |
|---|---|---||:--:||:---:||:--:|
| 5 | 0 | 5 || 
| 2 | 5 | 8 || 
| 0 | 3 | 9 || 
| 3 | 2 | 0 || 
| 8 | 4 | 2 || 
| 1 | 2 | 4 || 






---

## Function examples

| `\(x\)` | `\(y\)` | `\(z\)` || `\(f(x,y) = x - y\)`  || `\(g(z) = 2z - 1\)` || `\(h(x,y,z) = \displaystyle\frac{x+y}{z}\)` |
|---|---|---||:--:||:---:||:--:|
| 5 | 0 | 5 || 5                 || 9               || 1    |
| 2 | 5 | 8 || -3                || 15              || .875 |
| 0 | 3 | 9 || -3                || 17              || .333 |
| 3 | 2 | 0 || 1                 || -1              || *undefined*  |
| 8 | 4 | 2 || 4                 || 3               || 6    |
| 1 | 2 | 4 || -1                || 7               || .75





---

## Nested functions

Given that all functions do is map an input to an output, we can nest functions


- Imagine we perform one function `\(f(\cdot)\)`
- Output from `\(f(\cdot)\)` serves as the input for `\(g(\cdot)\)`
- `\(g(f(\cdot))\)`

--

Functions are evaluated "inside out" following the order of operations

--

Suppose `\(x = 3\)`, `\(f(x) = 2x + 5\)`, `\(g(x) = x - 7\)`

--

`$$f(g(x)) = ?$$`

--

`$$g(f(x)) = ?$$`






---

## Piecewise-defined functions

A *piecewise-defined function* has different definitions for different regions of the domain (domain = function inputs)

--

.pull-left[
`$$f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0 \\ x &amp; \text{if } x \in [0, 1] \\ x^{2} &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 1 \end{array}\right.$$`

.pull-left[
`$$g(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} x+3 &amp; \text{if } x \in (-\infty,0)\\ 4   &amp; \text{if } x = 0  \\ x-3 &amp; \text{if } x \in (0,\infty) \end{array}\right.$$`

### Function practice

##  Practice

Sketch graphs of the following functions:

- `\(p(x) = 2x - 1\)`, on the interval `\([-2, 2]\)`

- `\(q(x) = x * -1^{x}\)`, for integers `\(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)`

- `\(r(x) = 2x^{2} - 3x + 4\)`, on the interval `\((0, 4)\)`

### Important functions, routines, and properties


---

## Limits

*Limits* will help us formally define concepts in this lecture.

A *limit* describes a function's behavior at a given input: `\(\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0}\left( 2 - x^{2} \right) = 2\)`

...or as the input value changes: `\(\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty}\left( 2 - x^{2} \right) = -\infty\)`


&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/limit_example-1.png" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Continuity

A function is *continuous* if it has no gaps or jumps. 

`$$\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$$`

Meaning... small changes in input produce small changes in output

&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/continuity-1.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## In the wild

---

## In the wild: Continuity and Discontinuity

Why we care about continuity

--

- Differentiation (derivatives), which is good for...

--

- Utility functions (game theory)

--

- How some variable affects another variable (statistical models)

--

- More on Wednesday



---

## Continuity and Discontinuity

Why we care about discontinuity: *regression discontinuity*

--

- causal inference method: units are "treated" if above/below a threshold
--

- Popular example: vote share to wins and losses, wins and losses affect future fundraising




--

]







---

## Monotonicity

A function is *monotonic* if it always increases (monotonically increasing) or always decreases (monotonically decreasing)

- increasing: for any `\(x_{1} &gt; x_{2}\)`, then `\(f(x_{1}) &gt; f(x_{2})\)`
- decreasing: for any `\(x_{1} &lt; x_{2}\)`, then `\(f(x_{1}) &lt; f(x_{2})\)`

&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/monotonic-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;





---

## Concavity and Convexity

Imagine you draw a line between two points along a function. A function (or segment of a function) is *concave* if this line is below the function, and *convex* if the line is above the function.

- concave: `\(\frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} &lt; f\left( \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} \right)\)`

- convex: `\(\frac{f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2})}{2} &gt; f\left( \frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} \right)\)`

&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/concavity-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;






---

# Invertible functions

A function maps an input to an output. A function is *invertible* if there exists a reverse function that maps the output back to the input.

Formally: if `\(y = f(x)\)`, then `\(f^{-1}(y) = x\)`

Also: `\(f^{-1}\left( f(x) \right) = x\)`

&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/inverse-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---

## Exponents

The *exponent* operator multiplies a number by itself the number of times indicated in the exponent

`$$x^n = x * x * ... * x \quad (n \text{ times})$$`

&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/exponents-1.png" width="1000" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;





---

## Roots

*Root* operators return the number that, when multiplied by itself the number of times indicated in the root, is equal to the input.  When no number is given, that indicates the *square root*.


`$$x = \sqrt[n]{x} * \sqrt[n]{x}... \sqrt[n]{x} \quad (n \text{ times})$$`


&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/root-1.png" width="600" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;







---

## Exponents and Roots

All roots can be expressed as exponents (with the same properties)

`$$\sqrt[n]{x} \equiv x^{\frac{1}{n}}$$`

Important properties for exponents and roots 

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Zeroth power   | `\(x^{0} = 1\)`   |

## Two important continuous, monotonic, invertible functions: &lt;br&gt; Exponentials and Logarithms





---

## Exponentials and Logarithms


The *logarithm* (log) of some value `\(y\)` (with base `\(b\)`) is...

...the *power* to which that base would need to be raised to equal `\(y\)`

`$$\text{If } b^{x} = y\text{, then} \log_{b}(y) = x$$`

Exponentials and logarithms are inverse functions. Logs "undo" exponentials, and exponentials "undo" logs.



---

## Exponentials and Logarithms

We can see this because exponentials and logs are *reflections of each other* over `\(y = x\)` (one way to identify inverse functions)

---

## Exponents `\(\neq\)` Exponentials

Exponent: `\(x^2\)` ( `\(x\)` is the base)

Exponentials: `\(2^{x}\)` ( `\(x\)` is the power)

## Better yet...

What happens when you exponentiate a parabola? 

`$$f(x) = e^{-x^{2}}$$`

---

## Rules for logarithms

The following apply to all logs, regardless of base

| | |
|-|-|
| Log 1 | `\(\log(1) = 0\)` |
| Log 0 | undefined, approaches `\(-\infty\)` |
| Multiplication | `\(\log(x * y) = \log(x) + \log(y)\)` |
| Division | `\(\log(\frac{x}{y}) = \log(x) - \log(y)\)` | 
| Exponentiation | `\(\log(x^{a}) = a * \log(x)\)` | 
| Basis | `\(\log_{b}(b^{x}) = x\)` |

## You *WILL* use logs and exponents

### They are important for *probability distributions*

`$$\displaystyle f(x \mid \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}e^{- \frac{(x - \mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}$$`


&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/normal_pdf-1.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

### Common transformations in *nonlinear models*

---

### They are helpful for analytic manipulation of equations 

e.g. Maximum likelihood estimation

--

We flip a coin `\(n = 5\)` times and get `\(y = 4\)` heads. What's the probability of a heads `\((\pi)\)`?

--

Probability mass function for a binomial outcome ( `\(n\)` independent trials, `\(y\)` successes, success probability `\(\pi\)`): `\(\mathrm{Pr}\left( y = k \mid \pi \right) = {n \choose k} \pi^{k}(1 - \pi)^{n - k}\)`

Plug in our data: `\(\mathrm{Pr}\left( y = 4 \mid \pi \right) = {5 \choose 4} \pi^{4}(1 - \pi)^{5 - 4}\)`

--


Log probability: 
`\(\log\left(\mathrm{Pr} (y = 4 \mid \pi) \right) = \log {5 \choose 4} + 4 \log(\pi) + (5 - 4) \log(1 - \pi)\)`

--

This function defines the (log) probability of our data, as a function of an unknown `\(\pi\)`.

--

If we maximize this function with respect to `\(\pi\)`, we find the `\(\pi\)` value that gives us the greatest probability. That is, the *most likely value of `\(\pi\)`* that could give us these data.

### Logs get easier with experience, which you will have




---

## Base `\(e\)`

Although many early examples with logs use some arbitrary base (like base 10, the "common log"), most applications use base `\(e\)` ( `\(\log_{e}{}\)`, the "natural log", LN)

- `\(e\)` = Euler's number, approximately `\(2.718281828\)` ... 

--


- `\(e^{1} = e\)`
- `\(\log(e) = 1\)`

--


- `\(e^{0} = 1\)`
- `\(\log(1) = 0\)`



---

## Why base `\(e\)`?

It turns out that `\(e\)` is very important for functions that have constant and continuous growth rates (e.g. compounding interest)

--

Similar properties in probability

--

If you roll an `\(n\)` sided die `\(n\)` times, the probability of getting side `\(n\)` exactly zero times approaches `\(\frac{1}{e}\)` (as `\(n\)` increases)

--

We will emphasize the value of base `\(e\)` when we talk about probability (and the concept of *odds*)

## Some practice with logs and exponents



---

## Logs and Exponents

If `\(f(x) = \log_{10}{(x)}\)`, what is `\(f(1000)\)`?

--

- `\(\log_{10}{(1000)} = 3\)`, because `\(10^{3} = 1000\)`


--

If `\(g(x) = \mathrm{ln}\left( \frac{x}{e} \right)\)`, what is `\(g(4)\)`?

--

- `\(\begin{align} \mathrm{ln}\left(\frac{4}{e}\right) &amp;= \mathrm{ln}(4) - \mathrm{ln}(e) \\ &amp;\approx 1.386 - 1 \\ &amp;\approx 0.386\end{align}\)`

--

If `\(h(x) = \log_{2}\left(x^{5}\right)\)`, what is `\(h(4)\)`?

--

- `\(\begin{align} \log_{2}\left(4^{5}\right) &amp;= 5 \log_{2}(4) \\ &amp;= 5 * 2 \\ &amp;= 10\end{align}\)`




---

## Solve:

- `\(\log_{2}\left( 4^{3} \right)\)`

- `\(\ln\left( \frac{x}{y} * q^{4} * e \right)\)`



---

## Now for something slightly easier



---

## Absolute value

The absolute value operator returns the positive representation of a number

`$$|x| = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x &amp; \text{if } x \text{ is positive} \\ -x &amp; \text{if } x  \text{ is negative} \end{array} \right.$$`


&lt;img src="/Users/michaeldecrescenzo/Box Sync/workshops/math-camp/lectures/1-pre-calc/lecture-1-pre-calc_files/figure-html/abs-1.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;




---

## Multiplying polynomials

Polynomial: an expression with variables and coefficients, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents

`$$x^{3} + 5x^{2} + 4x^{2} + 7$$`

Which are variables, which are coefficients?

--

Multiply them by *distributing*: every element of each polynomial must be multiplied by every element of the other polynomial, then group terms by the powers of the variables.

Assume `\(a\)`, `\(b\)`, and `\(c\)` are coefficients, what is `\(ax \left( bx^{2} + x \right) \, ?\)`

--

`$$ax \left( bx^{2} + x \right) = \left( ax \cdot bx^{2} \right) + \left( ax \cdot c \right)$$`

--

`$$ax \left( bx^{2} + x \right) = abx^{2} + acx$$` 




---

## Multiplying polynomials: FOIL

**F**irst, **O**utside, **I**nside, **L**ast: for polynomials that each have two terms

`$$(ax + b) \cdot (cx + d)$$`

How do we FOIL?
--

- First: `\(ax \cdot cx\)`
--

- Outside: `\(ax \cdot d\)`
--

- Inside: `\(b \cdot cx\)`
--

- Last: `\(b \cdot d\)`

--

What do we get? 

--

`$$acx^2 + adx + bcx + bd$$`






---

## Longer polynomials

They work the same way, just keep track of all the terms. (FOIL is the same as distributing)

`$$(2x^{4} + 5x^{3}) \cdot (8x^{2} + x + 3) = \, ?$$`

--

`$$= (2x^{4} \cdot 8x^{2}) + (2x^{4} \cdot x) + (2x^{4} \cdot 3) + (5x^{3} \cdot 8x^{2}) + (5x^{3} \cdot x) + (5x^{3} \cdot 3)$$`


`$$= 16x^{6} + 2x^{5} + 6x^{4} + 40x^{5} + 5x^{4} + 15x^{3}$$`

`$$= 16x^{6} + 42x^{5} + 11x^{4} + 15x^{3}$$`

---

## Polynomial practice

Find the products:

- `\((x^2 + 3) \cdot (x - 2)\)`

- `\((3p + 4q) \cdot(p - 2q)\)`



---


## Factorials

The *factorial* operator (denoted with an exclamation mark `\(!\)`) returns the product of an integer with all lesser integers.

`$$x! = x \cdot (x - 1) \cdot (x - 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$`

--

An example: `\(10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * \ldots * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800\)`

--

Special factorials:

`$$1! = 1$$`

`$$0! = 1$$`

--

These come in handy when we do probabilities (combinations and permutations)
